# Genome Mapping

The goal of this project is to map sequences where we do not know the
genome level coordinates onto the correct genome.

To start with I will begin with sequences that already have a known
mapping. This will be the test set to see if the methodology works well.

We have several kinds of sequences that require matching:

- Exact sequences
- Inexact sequences
- Spliced Exact Sequences
- Spliced Inexact Sequences

These all require different levels of complexity and need to be treated
differently.
