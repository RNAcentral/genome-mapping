# Genome Mapping

This is a repo for me to explore how to map generic RNA sequences to a genome.
The general idea is that to use a variety of alignment programs for each type
of sequence and organism to properly create a mapping.

# Dependencies

- bedtools
- python 2.7
  - Along with all the packages in requirements.txt
- [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv)

# Usage

```sh
bin/pombe
```
